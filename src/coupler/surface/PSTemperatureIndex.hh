//! \brief A class implementing a temperature-index (positive degree-day) scheme
//! to compute melt and runoff, and thus surface mass balance, from
//! precipitation and air temperature.
/*! 
Temperature-index schemes are far from perfect as a way of modeling surface mass
balance on ice sheets which experience surface melt, but they are known to have
reasonable data requirements and to do a good job when tuned appropriately
[\ref Hock05].

This base class already accesses a fair amount of functionality.  It holds a
pointer to an instance of the LocalMassBalance class.  This class has method
LocalMassBalance::getMassFluxFromTemperatureTimeSeries() which uses the
precipitation during the ice sheet model time step, plus a variable temperature
over that time step, to compute melt, refreeze, and surface balance.
